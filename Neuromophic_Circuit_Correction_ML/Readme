Tool: Spectre

Version: IC616

Descriptions: This folder contains the data of a neuromoprhic circuit (using ReRAM) which predict the digit of a given handwritten image based on the output voltage at the final stage. There are 1797 data.

Files:

data_1797.csv: 10 voltage outputs and the actual digit.  
input.scs: input file example to simulate the neuromorphic circuit
output_0.txt: 10 voltage predictions from the neuromorphic circuit (this corresponds to the first row in data_1797.csv)
