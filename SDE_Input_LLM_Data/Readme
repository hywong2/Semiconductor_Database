TCAD Tool: TCAD Sentaurus

TCAD Version: O-2018.06

Descriptions: This is about generating nanowire structure file based on natural language. Each pair has a natural language description and Sentaurus Structure Editor command file.

The 7k2x.json file was the dataset used to train the best model from llama_3.1_instruct model from Meta.
