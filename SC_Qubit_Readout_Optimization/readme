Descriptions: Optimize readout pulse to minimize the readout error. Data are generated using Matlab simulation code as a function of power, Q, measurement frequency, F, and pulse Width.

Files:

I_Q_Blob_Data.xlsx: I Q data for manually optimized and machine optimized |1>/|0> readout (Fig. 10 in the paper)
alldata_53_and_11.zip: 4266 data (Readout error as a function of various parameters). Each file contains the fidelity (e.g. 100 means 100%). The filename has the following meaning:
e.g. power=-4+HFSS_no=1+Q=56000+Chi=120000+F=7252486100+Width=2.1e-06: 
power=-4 means -4dB lower than nominal
HFSS_no = 1 means not using HFSS to calculate S21 but using the analytical equation
Q = Quality factor
Chi = the difference between |0> and |1> shifts (see the introduction section)
F = Measurement frequency
Width = Readout pulse width in seconds.
